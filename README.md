# (Reusable) Security Workflows

Security Workflows is an example repository showing you how to use [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for code scanning. 

This repository and the contained workflows are only intended to be used as examples.  

## Why use reusable workflows?

Three reasons:
* **Centralization**: All configs are managed in a single location with auditing and change management associated with every modification to the configuration files.  
* **Simplicity**: All of the complexity is extracted away from developers.  Devs only need to worry about a single, simple caller workflow.  All the complex stuff is built into the reusable workflows stored in this repo.  
* **Flexibility**: Need to add, remove, or update a tool?  No prob üëç.  Modify the centralized workflow and all your repositories will take that change on their next PR. 

## When **not** to use reusable workflows?
If you only have code scanning enabled on a handfull of repos, it's probably best to manage those configurations separately.  A centralized code scanning workflow may be more complicated than what you need.  Remember... K.I.S.S.

If you only run CodeQL and no other code scanning tools, there's no need to add complexity with a centralized workflow.  

Finally, apps that have complex build steps or environment requirements for CodeQL are also probably not a good fit for a centralized workflow.  If your CodeQL setup process requires additional actions to configure Java versions, or really complex build commands, separate the CodeQL workflow into it's own file in the remote repo and continue to use the centralized workflow for the remaining tools.

## How does the reusable workflow work?
 [This](.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml) reusable workflow defines the steps for multiple tools including:
 * CodeQL
 * Dependency Review
 * Anchore
 * tf-sec
 * OSSF Scorecards

At the start of the workflow, we define inputs.  These inputs define the languages for CodeQL, build steps for CodeQL (if needed), and the option to skip any of the tools included in the workflow.
``` yaml
on: 
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
        languages:
          required: true
          type: string
        skip-codeql: 
          required: false
          type: boolean
          default: false
        ...
        skip-anchore: 
          required: false
          type: boolean
          default: false
        skip-dependency-review: 
          required: false
          type: boolean
          default: false
        build-command: 
          required: false
          type: string
          default: ''
```
 The following sections are all separate jobs which are run as part of the workflow.  Each job represents a different tool that is executed.

## How do I call the workflow?
Calling the centralized workflow is simple.  In the repository where you want to introduce code scanning, create a new Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows` and name it `<name_you_choose>.yml`.  The workflow will look like this:
``` yaml
name: Centralized Code Scanning

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    # The branches below must be a subset of the branches above
    branches: [ "main" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '42 13 * * 1'

jobs:
  # This job calls the centralized code scanning workflow
  scanning:
    uses: octodemo/security-workflows/.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      # This section is used to tell CodeQL which languages you need to scan in the repo
      languages: " [ "python", "javascript" ] "
      
 ```
 
 To skip a specific test from in the caller workflow, add a flag:
``` yaml
name: Centralized Code Scanning

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '21 17 * * 5'


jobs:
  scanning:
    uses: octodemo/security-workflows/.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      languages: " [ 'go'] "
      skip-scorecards: true 
      
```

## How do I implement through a starter workflow?

Starter workflows allow everyone in your organization who has permission to create workflows to do so more quickly and easily. When you create a new workflow, you can choose a starter workflow and some or all of the work of writing the workflow will be done for you. You can use starter workflows as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is. This not only saves time, it promotes consistency and best practice across your organization.

Start from the the provided `starter-workflow.yml` template:  
```yaml
# This workflow can be used as a starter workflow in your org for calling your reusable code scanning workflow
# more info about creating starter workflows here: https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization

name: Centralized Code Scanning

on:
  push:
    branches: [ $default-branch, $protected-branches ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ $default-branch ]
  schedule:
    - cron: $cron-weekly


jobs:
  # This job calls the centralized code scanning workflow
  scanning:
    uses: octodemo/security-workflows/.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      # This section is used to tell CodeQL which languages you need to scan in the repo
      languages: " [ $detected-codeql-languages ] "
      # Autobuild failed?  uncomment the following line and add your build command
      # build-comand: "./build.sh"
      # Need to disable one of the tools from being run?  Uncomment the appropriate line below
      # skip-codeql: true
      # skip-scorecards: true 
      # skip-tfsec: true
      # skip-anchore: true
      # skip-dependency-review: true
 ```


Using the organziation's `.github` repository, add the starter template along with a metadata file under the special `workflow-templates` directory as described in: [Creating starter workflows for your organization
](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization#creating-a-starter-workflow). 

You can take reference in the following sample configuration [template](https://github.com/octodemo/.github/blob/master/workflow-templates/reusable-code-scanning.yml) and [metadata](https://github.com/octodemo/.github/blob/master/workflow-templates/reusable-code-scanning.properties.json).
